Is durian allowed in flight?
“It’s not illegal to carry durian in a flight as long as it is wrapped properly in accordance with flight regulations – 
carried inside the hold,” a Sriwijaya Air spokesperson said in a statement. “Many airlines do this.” 
Singapore has banned the transport of durian fruit on the subway.
